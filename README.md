# idevaffiliate Drupal module

A Drupal 8.x service for interacting with the [iDevAffiliate](https://www.idevdirect.com/) affiliate tracking system.

## Installation

In a Composer-managed project:
```
composer require bradjonesllc/idevaffiliate

Enable in Drupal and configure at `/admin/config/idevaffiliate/config`. This module does nothing on its own;
it provides a Symfony service with which you may integrate your own business rules.
